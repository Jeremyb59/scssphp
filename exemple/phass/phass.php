 * This tool compile all .scss files in a given folder into .css files in a given folder.
 * Everything happens right when you run your app, on-the-fly, in pure PHP. No Ruby needed, no configuration needed.
 *
 * The currently supported version of SCSS syntax is 3.2.12, which is the latest one.
 * The compiler uses the SCSS syntax, which is recommended and mostly used. The old SASS syntax is not supported.
 *
 * @see SASS Homepage: http://sass-lang.com/
 * @see scssphp, the used compiler (in PHP): http://leafo.net/scssphp/
